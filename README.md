# project-landing-page

This is the first full webpage that will be/will have been completely developed by me.

The goal is to recreate the final product using the skills I've learned in html and css, particularly the use of flexbox. I already have an initial plan and I hope that with this, my understanding of flexbox is at least enough to see me through without extremely intensive research
